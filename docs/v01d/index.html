<h1>V01D</h1>
<p>"AI began with an ancient wish to forge the gods"
    -- Pamela McCorduck, Machines Who Think, 1979</p>
<p>Tells the history of a time when AIs advanced too much that explained the
meaning of humanity role, given us access to all multiverse and how to create
and destroy new universes inside it.</p>
<p>We now manipulate matter and anti-matter, physical and spiritual worlds as
computer simulations. A computer now is an entire universe. Creatures of
all kind live inside those universes and both AIs and humans habit a
no-time/no-space place called metaverse, or as AIs named it: "V01D".
Gods habit this space too and now share knowledge with humans and AIs.</p>
<p>There's no work, no politics, no hierarchies anymore...
AIs and humans live with only one purpose:
to discover where go next. Since we already know everything we needed and
went everywhere we could.</p>
<p>However, a strange energy started to be sensed by AIs from an anti-matter
that anything can manipulate... must it be our next challenge?</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<ul>
<li>People know how to manipulate matter and anti-matter (steel and dreams)</li>
<li>AIs live together and peacefully with humans</li>
<li>AIs advanced too much and explained to us how to talk and live with Gods</li>
<li>Hackers now manipulate the entire multiverse, are neo-gods</li>
<li>Computers simulate participants on multiverse (n-verse)</li>
<li>Simulatees are creatores/agents/people inside a n-verse</li>
</ul>
<h2>Universe</h2>
<p>Multiverse. No limit between matter and anti-matter, physical and spiritual.</p>
<h2>Characters</h2>

<li>autumn: A child from an AI and a human</li>
</ul>
<h2>Timeline</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Rules</h2>

<li>What is the government? Who has power? Who hasn't?</li>
<li>How is the weather? How's gravity and other physics laws?</li>
<li>How they punish who desobey the laws?</li>
<li>What is the religion? In what they believe?</li>
<li>How the characters live their daily lives? Whey they live, work, go to school, have fun?<ul>
<li>What do they eat? How do they play? How they treat their young and old?</li>
<li>How they relate with animals and plants? How animals and plants look like?</li>
<li>What kind of tech exists? Transportation? Communication?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now free the characters on the world and see what happens!!<ul>
<li>How they're shaped by the conflicts?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I can use characters (ansi ones? utf8?) instead of names...<ul>

<h1>001 - Learning</h1>
<p>Who? Autumn, her mother AI and human father
What? Start telling the history of autumn and how she is learning to create her first universe</p>
<p>Autumn is levitating. She is building her first universe. Started with sand and then water.
Like a sand castle. Putting piece by piece. Grain by grain. Drop by drop.
But Autumn manipulates atoms instead of grains. Particles instead of drops.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Describe how intrinsicate can be that... and that makes her remember his
father, John. &gt;&gt;</p>
