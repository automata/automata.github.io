<h1>Agentic Future for agents to consume.</h1>
<p>Language is perhaps the most important human invention. Written one. As far as we understand, we're not the
only ones to have a language. Orcas and almost all animals share information somehow.
But written language was a powerful invention.</p>
<p>Computers are all about language. The way we evolved them from typewriters to dumb keyboards connected to green
flickering terminals, connected to mainframes, processing symbols, storing them, converting them to lower and
lower levels of languages.</p>
<p>And now we have LLMs. Large Language Models.</p>
<p>We created GUIs on top of those commands but in the end, what really matters is the information, the data.
And agents trill on data.</p>
<p>Softwares will be created by agents and consumed by agents.</p>
<p>Let's think about personas.</p>
<p>Researcher.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today:</li>
<li>Tomorrow: wants to understand a given behaviour. Open its cellphone,</li>
</ul>
<p>Coder</p>
<p>Marketing</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>We need to build the infrastructure to agents, paving the way to an agentic future.</p>
<p>Your repository should be agentic: agents.md, good docs (llm.txt), good feedback loops for your agent, tests (property-based, mutation, ...)</p>
<p>Your software should have an API, easily accessible, no auth complications, with good docs (examples, etc) for agents to consume.</p>
<p>Your software should do good for agents, let them save tokens!</p>
