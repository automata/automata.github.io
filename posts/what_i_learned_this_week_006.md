## Taste Is Not a Moat

[Shrivu Shankar](https://blog.sshh.io/p/taste-is-not-a-moat) challenges the popular belief that "taste" is a durable competitive advantage in an AI-dominated world. Instead, he argues taste works more like financial alpha -- a temporary edge that erodes as AI capabilities improve and the baseline resets every few months. The article traces how jobs are shifting from execution to "taste extraction": encoding human judgment into systems that scale it. He presents practical methods like A/B interviews with AI and ghost writing exercises to identify where your judgment actually adds value. The critical question he raises: if platforms collecting millions of user micro-signals end up owning taste extraction, does individual taste just become feed for larger systems?
